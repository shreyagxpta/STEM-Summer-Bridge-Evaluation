# STEM-Summer-Bridge-Evaluation
This project is for UC Berkeley's Data Science Honors Program (H195A & H195B).

This project aims to create a pipeline which can be used to evaluate the impact of STEM-based summer bridge programs via a multitude of non-academic indicators (e.g. feeling of belongingness, attitude to seeking help, etc.) and academic indicators (like final grades). This study is being set up with analysis of only one summer bridge program (the Baskin School of Engingeering Summer Bridge Program for underrepresented students).
